# Cosmology
Repository for the GRB Cosmolgy Research Iniative within the CAPIBARA Collaboration. This repository contains preliminar code for data analysis and cosmology research. The repository is divide into the following directoryes:

* ```comparingH0```: code for the comparison of differente $H_0$ results and studying the Hubble Tension, aka Crisis in Cosmology.
* ```gravitational_waves```: code to study the characteristics of GRB Gravitational wave counterpart detections.
* ```grb_simulation```: code for simulating a GRB event.
* ```sne_cosmo```: code from previous project, cosmological models using Ia SNe data.

You can check the research initiative description in the [project's website](https://capibara3.github.io/research/GRB_cosmology.html). You'll find a contact also there, feel free to reach out!
