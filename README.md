# Cosmology
Repository for the [GRB Cosmology Research Initiatve](https://capibara3.github.io/research/grb_cosmology.html) within the [CAPIBARA](https://github.com/capibara3) Collaboration. This repository contains code for general cosmology status review and for specifically GRB-related distance measurements. The repository is divided into the following sub-directories:

1. `lit-review`: code for plotting of main cosmological parameters (e.g. $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_{DE}$) from literature data $\implies$ Hubble Tension :).
2. `gw`: computing characteristics of GRB gravitational wave (GW) counterpart detections.
3. `friedmann`: my Python version of [gcanasherrera/calculadoracosmologica](https://github.com/gcanasherrera/calculadoracosmologica), computing different cosmological distances and times using the friedmann eqs.
3. `simulations`: code from previous project, cosmological simulatiosn using `astropy` methods.
