# Cosmology
Repository for the [GRB Cosmolgy Research Iniative](https://capibara3.github.io/research/grb_cosmology.html) within the CAPIBARA Collaboration. This repository contains preliminar code for data analysis and cosmology research. The repository is divided into the following directories:

* `comparingH0`: code for the comparison of different $H_0$ results and studying the Hubble Tension, aka Crisis in Cosmology.
* `gw`: code to study the characteristics of GRB Gravitational wave counterpart detections.
* `simulations`: code from previous project, cosmological simulations using astropy models.

You can check the research initiative description in the [project's website](https://capibara3.github.io/research/GRB_cosmology.html). You'll find a contact also there, feel free to reach out!
